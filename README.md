# MSSA Programming Portfolio

A repository intended to demonstrate my knowledge of the C# programming language and depict my progression through the 16-week course.

## Project Tasks:

- [X] Find suitable example programs hopefully written by professional programmers,

- [X] Carefully read the program code to figure out (as much as possible) what the program does and how it does it

- [X] Document your findings by annotating the code with program comments that demonstrate your understanding of the program

- [X] Compile and get the program running... debug it if necessary

- [X] Augment the program to better demonstrate its functionality

- [X] Capture the program output and append it to the end of your source code

## Required Segments:

	1. The original source code of the sample program

	2. Document the source and (if possible) the author of the sample program

	3. Summarize the program functionality in a one-liner comment

	4. Summarize your changes and improvements to the program

	5. The final source code of the sample program

	6. A terminal comment containing the sample program output

## Organization Strategy:

	The repository is organized into multiple folders to separate programs by programming concept with each
	folder containing a separate ReadMe with the output of each program displayed as images and sample input
	which the programs accept.
