# MSSA Programming Portfolio

A repository intended to demonstrate my knowledge of the C# programming language and depict my progression through the 16-week course.

## Project Tasks:

-[ ] Find suitable example programs hopefully written by professional programmers,

-[ ] Carefully read the program code to figure out (as much as possible) what the program does and how it does it

-[ ] Document your findings by annotating the code with program comments that demonstrate your understanding of the program

-[ ] Compile and get the program running... debug it if necessary

-[ ] Augment the program to better demonstrate its functionality

-[ ] Capture the program output and append it to the end of your source code

## Required Segments:

	1. The original source code of the sample program

	2. Document the source and (if possible) the author of the sample program

	3. Summarize the program functionality in a one-liner comment

	4. Summarize your changes and improvements to the program

	5. The final source code of the sample program

	6. A terminal comment containing the sample program output

## Organization Strategy:

	The repository is organized into multiple folders to separate programs by use as well as dividing Solutions into its unique Projects 	which may require unique explanations for their interaction.

	The naming convention within the /Conceptual is <CATEGORY_NAMESPACE> for organization without creating additional folder instrastructure
