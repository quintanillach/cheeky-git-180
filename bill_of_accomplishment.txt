I believe my portfolio deserves a 96 percent for meeting all outlined tasks, providing each
segment for the entire 50 programs, and presenting them in a professional manner. Each program 
was refactored using the concepts learned throughout the course and all are functional and less 
prone to crashes than the original source code. The portfolio also includes several challenge 
programs, the most difficult method of learning recommended in the syllabus. The portfolio 
could be made a 100 percent worthy product if I were to write tests for at least five of the 
programs to prove this concept. I could also write a few original programs to show creativity 
and added effort.
